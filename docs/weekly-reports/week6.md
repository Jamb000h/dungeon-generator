# Week 6

This week I wanted to get my test coverage to proper levels (100% - See [test document](../test.md)) and start work on a secondary algorithm to have some comparison between two alternatives.

I decided to do something based on cellular dungeon generation as the foundation is easy to implement and there is a lot to improve on to make it better. I'm not yet sure what I'm going to do with it before the course ends, but I not have the base working and visualized with steps (and tested too).

My plan for the last two weeks is to come up with some nice optimizations and/or enhancements to the cellular dungeon generation and implement some of those. If there's enough time before the project ends I'd imagine combining both approaches to one would be interesting. I'd imagine it would be possible to take the completely generated BSP + AStar map and feed that to the cellular algorithm and run a few iterations to make it look more organic. The problem (in my mind at least) lies in the constraints that are necessary to keep the routing intact. But I hope to get to try that!

## Time used

I used approximately 8 hours this week.
