## General Description

The project tries to produce an efficient dungeon generation algorithm that generates dungeons that:

- contain multiple rooms
- may contain rooms that are very different in size
- contain routes between rooms
- may contain rooms that connect to each other
- ensures that all rooms are accessible without too long detours

## Chosen algorithms and data structures

### Binary Space Partitioning ([1], [2], [4])

Used for room generation as it ensures there is no overlap and it is fairly efficient. As per [4] it should have a time and space complexity of `O(n log n)`

BSP was chosen for room generation as it provides an efficient way of splitting a map into separate areas that rooms can then be generated into.

### A\* [3]

Used for route generation between doors.

A\* should be good enough for finding paths between doors and it is going to use the manhattan distance to the goal door as its heuristic. The problem here is that this may generate dungeons that may have several roads next to each other, which is something that has to be mitigated somehow.

As manhattan distance as a heuristic has time complexity of `O(1)`, and each cell in the map is evaluated at most 4 times as we only allow horizontal or vertical movement, the time complexity should be `4 * map size` (n \* m), which equals `O(4nm)` and space complexity should be at most `O(nm)`.

## Inputs

The program will get a map size as its primary input. Secondary inputs are maximum and minimum room height and width and if it is possible to connect rooms to each other without routes.

Map size is given as two integers x and y, which represent the map width and height. Room min/max sizes are given as integers and determine the minimum and maximum value when splitting the map with BSP. Possibility to connect rooms is used when generating rooms in the partitions generated by BSP by either adding or omitting a padding in the partition.
