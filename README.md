# Dungeon generator

The project tries to produce an efficient dungeon generation algorithm that generates dungeons that:

- contain multiple rooms
- may contain rooms that are very different in size
- contain routes between rooms
- may contain rooms that connect to each other
- ensures that all rooms are accessible without too long detours
